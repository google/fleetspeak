# Unit test for client.
#
# This script reserves ports and then starts two processes which communicate
# with each other using these ports:
#
# 1) A loopback python script based on the grpcservice client library.
#
# 2) A tester which is, primarily, a fleetspeak server with the grpcservice
# installed.
#
# Then the tester sends a message through the loopback, as if it came from a
# client, and waits for the looped message to come back to the same client.
#
# (Alternatively, this could be done by spawning loopback with tester, but using
# independent processes is more realistic.)

# Exit on error.
